## Nadion

Async task executor library for JRuby that uses [concurrent-ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) executors and the [LMAX Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor) as the backing messaging library. It provides a familiar interface borrowed from other popular task scheduling libraries like [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) and [Sucker Punch](https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch)
